[{"content":"Context: Why This Project Matters, Who It’s For, and What You’ll Learn In this post, I’m excited to share a recent development—an AI agent powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), OpenAI, and Google APIs that can set up meetings on your calendar and send notification emails, all triggered by simple natural language commands. This project is designed for developers, tech enthusiasts, and productivity geeks who want to explore the power of LLMs in real-world task automation.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll learn how an AI agent can understand contextual prompts and use structured protocols like MCP to call APIs for practical outcomes—like scheduling a meeting or notifying participants via Gmail. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in automating workflows with natural language interfaces, this is for you.\nBackground: What Inspired This Project The idea came from a common frustration—having to juggle between chat, calendars, and emails just to organize one meeting. So I built a smart AI agent that interprets my intent using OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s LLM, and then takes real-world actions using:\nGoogle Calendar API to schedule meetings. Gmail API to send emails. MCP (Model Context Protocol) to structure and manage context-aware tasks reliably. import os import sys import time from openai import OpenAI, RateLimitError from dotenv import load_dotenv from typing import Optional import backoff # Load environment variables sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))) load_dotenv() # Constants THREAD_ID_FILE = \u0026#34;thread_id.txt\u0026#34; MODEL_NAME = \u0026#34;gpt-4-turbo\u0026#34; MAX_RETRIES = 3 INITIAL_RETRY_DELAY = 2 MAX_RETRY_DELAY = 60 class AssistantManager: def __init__(self): # Initialize API key and OpenAI client self.api_key = os.getenv(\u0026#34;OPENAI_API_KEY\u0026#34;) self.client = OpenAI(api_key=self.api_key, timeout=60.0, max_retries=5) # Test API connection with retries self.test_api_connection() # Load assistant configuration self.assistant_id = os.getenv(\u0026#34;ASSISTANT_ID\u0026#34;) self.load_or_create_assistant() # Load thread ID self.thread_id = self.load_thread_id() def test_api_connection(self): # Retry connection if rate limit error occurs retry_count = 0 while retry_count \u0026lt; MAX_RETRIES: try: models = self.client.models.list() break except RateLimitError as e: retry_count += 1 time.sleep(min(INITIAL_RETRY_DELAY * (2 ** retry_count), MAX_RETRY_DELAY)) def load_or_create_assistant(self): try: self.assistant = self.client.beta.assistants.retrieve(self.assistant_id) except Exception: self.create_new_assistant() def create_new_assistant(self): # Create a new assistant if not found self.assistant = self.client.beta.assistants.create( name=\u0026#34;Email Assistant\u0026#34;, instructions=\u0026#34;Assistant instructions\u0026#34;, model=MODEL_NAME ) self.assistant_id = self.assistant.id def load_thread_id(self) -\u0026gt; Optional[str]: # Load thread ID from file if os.path.exists(THREAD_ID_FILE): with open(THREAD_ID_FILE, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;) as file: return file.read().strip() return None def save_thread_id(self, thread_id: str) -\u0026gt; None: # Save thread ID to file with open(THREAD_ID_FILE, \u0026#34;w\u0026#34;) as file: file.write(thread_id) def process_user_input(self, user_input: str) -\u0026gt; bool: # Process user input, reset thread or quit if user_input.lower() == \u0026#34;reset\u0026#34;: self.reset_thread() return True elif user_input.lower() == \u0026#34;quit\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Goodbye.\u0026#34;) return False # Handle conversation logic return True def reset_thread(self) -\u0026gt; None: # Reset the conversation thread self.thread_id = None if os.path.exists(THREAD_ID_FILE): os.remove(THREAD_ID_FILE) def run(self) -\u0026gt; None: # Main conversation loop while True: user_input = input(\u0026#34;Enter your message: \u0026#34;) if not self.process_user_input(user_input): break if __name__ == \u0026#34;__main__\u0026#34;: assistant_manager = AssistantManager() assistant_manager.run() How It Works: Behind the Scenes The agent listens to a single instruction like:\n“Schedule a meeting with Mamun on Monday at 3 PM about the RecSys project and send him a confirmation email.”\nAnd it performs the following steps:\nParses the command using OpenAI LLM. Creates an MCP request to store the user’s intent and current context. Calls the Google Calendar API to create a new event. Uses the Gmail API to send a formatted email with meeting details. The key here is context tracking with MCP. It ensures the agent understands who is involved, when the meeting should occur, and what it’s about—even if I just say, “Book it like the last one, but with Sara.”\nKey Components \u0026amp; Technologies OpenAI GPT-4: For command parsing and decision-making. MCP (Model Context Protocol): For structuring AI-agent memory and task execution. Google Calendar API: For event creation and modification. Gmail API: For sending meeting emails. Python \u0026amp; Flask: As the glue to orchestrate LLM output and API calls. Future Scope Add voice command support. Allow recurring meetings and conflict resolution. Integrate Slack or WhatsApp bot support for command input. Final Thoughts This agent proves how AI isn’t just about chat—it’s about action. With just one sentence, I can automate multiple backend operations, making daily workflows faster and smarter. I’ll be sharing the full code soon.

In the previous installments, we laid the groundwork: Part 1 introduced foundational techniques like collaborative filtering (CF) and Matrix Factorization (MF), which excelled at capturing user-item interactions but assumed linearity, missing complex patterns. Part 2 explored Factorization Machines (FM) and XGBoost, which tackled sparse data and non-linear ranking but fell short on higher-order interactions and sequential behaviors. By 2016, these limitations spurred a seismic shift toward deep neural networks (DNNs), which transformed RecSys by learning intricate feature interactions, automating feature engineering, and addressing diverse tasks like sequential recommendations and multi-task optimization. This post traces that evolution from 2016 to 2023, diving into Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), Wide \u0026amp; Deep Learning, DeepFM, Deep Interest Network (DIN), Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM), and Adaptive Task-to-Task Fusion (AdaTT). It’s tailored for data scientists, ML engineers, and tech professionals—particularly those designing large-scale RecSys in domains like e-commerce, streaming, and advertising—who need a deep, technical understanding of these advancements.\nRecap: Where We Left Off In Part 2, we saw how FM extended MF by modeling pairwise feature interactions, making it a powerhouse for sparse settings like click-through rate (CTR) prediction. Its prediction function, ( \\hat{y}(\\mathbf{x}) = w_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=i+1}^n \\langle v_i, v_j \\rangle x_i x_j ), captured second-order relationships efficiently but couldn’t handle higher-order interactions or non-linear patterns beyond its linear assumptions. XGBoost, meanwhile, leveraged tree ensembles to rank items based on non-linear feature combinations, shining in tasks like top-N recommendations. Yet, it struggled with high-dimensional sparse data and required extensive manual feature engineering, limiting its scalability. These gaps—missing deep non-linearities, higher-order interactions, and sequential modeling—paved the way for DNNs, which, starting in 2016, redefined RecSys by learning complex patterns directly from raw data.\nThe Big Picture: The Deep Learning Revolution in RecSys Picture a recommendation system as a guide helping you navigate a vast library. In Part 2, our guide used simple rules: FM paired clues like your reading history with book traits, while XGBoost ranked options by studying everyone’s preferences. But what if your interests shift over time (say, from mysteries to sci-fi), or the guide needs to predict both what you’ll read and whether you’ll buy it? These earlier methods faltered. DNNs emerged as a smarter guide, capable of deciphering intricate patterns, tracking sequential behaviors, and juggling multiple goals. From 2016’s Wide \u0026amp; Deep to 2023’s AdaTT, this era saw RecSys evolve to handle complex user behaviors with unprecedented accuracy, shaping modern systems in companies like Google, Alibaba, and Facebook.\nDeep Dive: The Evolution of DNNs in RecSys Let’s explore this journey, starting with Neural Collaborative Filtering, which kicked off the DNN era by rethinking how we model user-item interactions.\nNeural Collaborative Filtering (NCF, 2017) Traditional MF, a staple from Part 1, predicts user-item interactions via a dot product: ( \\hat{r}_{ui} = p_u^T q_i ), where ( p_u ) and ( q_i ) are latent vectors for user ( u ) and item ( i ). This worked well for explicit ratings but assumed linearity, missing non-linear patterns in implicit feedback like clicks or views. In 2017, He et al. proposed Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) to overcome this, replacing the dot product with a neural network to capture complex, non-linear relationships. The motivation was clear: real-world preferences aren’t linear—liking sci-fi movies doesn’t linearly predict liking sci-fi books—and DNNs, fresh from successes in vision and NLP, offered a way to model these nuances.\nNCF’s architecture comes in three flavors. First, the inputs are simple: one-hot encoded user ID ( \\mathbf{u} ) and item ID ( \\mathbf{i} ), mapped to dense embeddings ( \\mathbf{p}_u ) and ( \\mathbf{q}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{32} ) via lookup tables. The Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF) variant mimics MF but with a neural twist: it computes an element-wise product ( \\mathbf{p}_u \\odot \\mathbf{q}i ), feeds it through a linear layer with weights ( \\mathbf{w} ), and applies a sigmoid activation to output a probability: ( \\hat{y}{ui} = \\sigma(\\mathbf{w}^T (\\mathbf{p}_u \\odot \\mathbf{q}_i)) ). This retains MF’s linear interaction but learns the weighting neurally. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) variant takes a different tack, concatenating the embeddings into ( [\\mathbf{p}_u, \\mathbf{q}_i] ) and passing them through three fully connected layers (e.g., 256, 128, 64 neurons) with ReLU activations: ( \\mathbf{z}_1 = \\text{ReLU}(\\mathbf{W}_1 [\\mathbf{p}u, \\mathbf{q}i] + \\mathbf{b}1) ), followed by more layers, ending in a prediction layer. This captures non-linear interactions unavailable to MF. Finally, Neural Matrix Factorization (NeuMF) combines both, concatenating GMF’s and MLP’s penultimate outputs and applying a final linear layer: ( \\hat{y}{ui} = \\sigma(\\mathbf{w}^T [\\mathbf{z}{\\text{GMF}}, \\mathbf{z}{\\text{MLP}}]) ). This hybrid leverages both linear and non-linear modeling.\nFor implicit feedback (e.g., clicks), NCF uses binary cross-entropy as its loss: ( L = -\\sum_{(u,i) \\in D} [y_{ui} \\log(\\hat{y}{ui}) + (1-y{ui}) \\log(1-\\hat{y}{ui})] ), where ( y{ui} = 1 ) for observed interactions and 0 otherwise. Since unobserved pairs vastly outnumber observed ones, negative sampling (e.g., 4 negatives per positive) keeps training feasible. The optimizer is Adam, with a learning rate of 0.001, balancing speed and stability. On the MovieLens 1M dataset, NeuMF achieved a Hit Ratio@10 of 0.71, beating MF’s 0.67 by 6%, thanks to its ability to model non-linear patterns. Compared to MLP alone (0.69), NeuMF’s fusion of GMF’s linearity and MLP’s depth proved superior. The special change—swapping a dot product for a neural network—unlocked this flexibility, though NCF ignores auxiliary features like user demographics and can’t model sequential behaviors.\nWide \u0026amp; Deep Learning (2016) NCF’s focus on user-item pairs left out contextual features and struggled with generalization in sparse, diverse settings. Enter Wide \u0026amp; Deep Learning, proposed by Cheng et al. at Google in 2016, designed for app recommendations on Google Play. The problem was twofold: linear models like logistic regression memorized specific patterns (e.g., “user installed app A”) but couldn’t generalize to unseen data, while DNNs generalized well but missed rare, critical interactions. Wide \u0026amp; Deep combined a linear “wide” model for memorization with a DNN “deep” model for generalization, aiming to balance both.\nThe architecture starts with inputs: sparse features (e.g., user ID, app ID) mapped to embeddings (e.g., 32 dimensions) and dense features (e.g., user age) fed raw. The wide component is a linear model: ( \\mathbf{y}{\\text{wide}} = \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x} + b ), where ( \\mathbf{x} ) includes raw features and hand-crafted cross-features (e.g., “user installed app A AND app B”), capturing low-order interactions. Designing these cross-features required domain expertise, a key modification over pure DNNs. The deep component is an MLP with three hidden layers (1024, 512, 256 neurons) using ReLU: ( \\mathbf{z}1 = \\text{ReLU}(\\mathbf{W}1 \\mathbf{e} + \\mathbf{b}1) ), where ( \\mathbf{e} ) concatenates embeddings and dense inputs, learning higher-order interactions. The outputs merge via a weighted sum: ( \\hat{y} = \\sigma(\\mathbf{w}{\\text{wide}}^T \\mathbf{y}{\\text{wide}} + \\mathbf{w}{\\text{deep}}^T \\mathbf{z}{\\text{deep}} + b) ), yielding a click probability.\nThe loss is logistic (binary cross-entropy), optimized differently per component: FTRL with L1 regularization for the wide part (encouraging sparsity) and AdaGrad for the deep part (adapting to dense gradients). On Google Play, Wide \u0026amp; Deep boosted app installations by 3.9% over a wide-only model and 1% over a deep-only model, proving the hybrid’s value. Unlike NCF, it leverages auxiliary features, but the manual engineering of cross-features limits scalability, and it doesn’t address sequential data or higher-order interactions beyond the wide part.\nDeepFM (2017) Wide \u0026amp; Deep’s reliance on manual feature engineering was a bottleneck, especially for large-scale systems with thousands of features. In 2017, Guo et al. introduced DeepFM, targeting CTR prediction in online advertising (e.g., Criteo dataset), by combining Factorization Machines (FM) with a DNN to automate feature interactions. FM’s strength was modeling pairwise interactions efficiently, but it missed higher-order patterns; DeepFM extended it to capture both low- and high-order interactions without human intervention.\nDeepFM’s inputs are sparse features (e.g., user ID, ad ID) mapped to embeddings ( \\mathbf{v}i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{10} ). The FM component computes: ( \\mathbf{y}{\\text{FM}} = w_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=i+1}^n \\langle \\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{v}_j \\rangle x_i x_j ), capturing second-order interactions via dot products. The deep component, an MLP with three 200-neuron layers and ReLU, takes the same embeddings: ( \\mathbf{z}1 = \\text{ReLU}(\\mathbf{W}1 \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{b}1) ), learning higher-order interactions. Sharing embeddings between FM and DNN ensures consistency and efficiency—a key design choice. The final output combines both: ( \\hat{y} = \\sigma(\\mathbf{y}{\\text{FM}} + \\mathbf{w}{\\text{deep}}^T \\mathbf{z}{\\text{deep}}) ).\nThe loss is binary cross-entropy, optimized with Adam (learning rate 0.001). On Criteo, DeepFM hit an AUC of 0.801, edging out Wide \u0026amp; Deep (0.799) and FM (0.785), as it automated feature engineering while retaining FM’s strengths. This modification—replacing Wide \u0026amp; Deep’s manual cross-features with FM—made it scalable, though it still overlooks sequential user behaviors critical for dynamic settings like e-commerce.\nDeep Interest Network (DIN, 2017) DeepFM’s static modeling couldn’t capture how user interests evolve, say, during an e-commerce browsing session. Zhou et al. at Alibaba introduced the Deep Interest Network (DIN) in 2017 to address this, using an attention mechanism to weigh historical behaviors based on their relevance to a candidate item. Proposed for ad recommendations, DIN recognized that not all past interactions (e.g., clicked items) equally inform the next click, necessitating a dynamic approach.\nDIN’s inputs include a user’s behavior sequence ( S_u = {v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_T} ) (e.g., clicked items), a candidate ad ( v_a ), and context features, all mapped to embeddings. The core innovation is the attention mechanism: for each historical item ( v_i ), it computes a weight ( \\alpha_i = f(\\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{v}_a) ) using a small MLP: ( f(\\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{v}_a) = \\text{ReLU}(\\mathbf{W} [\\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{v}_a, \\mathbf{v}_i \\odot \\mathbf{v}_a] + \\mathbf{b}) ). This weights items by relevance, forming a user interest vector ( \\mathbf{s}u = \\sum{i=1}^T \\alpha_i \\mathbf{v}i ). This vector, the candidate embedding, and context embeddings feed into an MLP with three layers (200, 80, 2 neurons) and ReLU, ending in a sigmoid output: ( \\hat{y} = \\sigma(\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{z}{\\text{deep}}) ).\nThe loss is binary cross-entropy, optimized with Adam (learning rate 0.001). On Alibaba’s dataset, DIN’s AUC of 0.82 beat DeepFM’s 0.80 by 2%, highlighting attention’s power in sequential modeling. Unlike DeepFM, DIN adapts to temporal dynamics, but it’s tailored to single-task CTR prediction, not multi-objective scenarios.\nDeep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM, 2019) DIN’s single-tower design wasn’t built for the massive scale and diverse features of systems like Facebook’s ad platform. In 2019, Naumov et al. proposed DLRM, a multi-tower architecture for CTR prediction, explicitly modeling pairwise interactions for scalability and interpretability. The need arose from handling billions of sparse features (e.g., ad IDs) alongside dense ones (e.g., user stats), where implicit modeling slowed training.\nDLRM’s inputs split into dense features (e.g., user age) and sparse features (e.g., user ID), mapped to embeddings. The dense tower is an MLP with three layers (512, 256, 128 neurons) and ReLU, processing continuous inputs. The sparse tower computes pairwise dot products between embeddings: ( \\mathbf{z}_{ij} = \\mathbf{v}_i^T \\mathbf{v}_j ), forming an interaction vector. These outputs concatenate with the dense tower’s result, feeding a top MLP (128, 1 neurons) with ReLU and sigmoid: ( \\hat{y} = \\sigma(\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{z}) ).\nThe loss is binary cross-entropy, optimized with Adam or SGD. On Criteo, DLRM’s AUC of 0.802 slightly topped DeepFM’s 0.801, with better scalability from its parallel towers—a key change over single-tower designs. However, it focuses on single-task CTR, not multi-task or sequential needs.\nAdaptive Task-to-Task Fusion (AdaTT, 2023) DLRM’s single-task focus couldn’t handle multi-objective RecSys, like predicting CTR and conversion rate (CVR) together. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) emerged to share representations across tasks, but task conflicts often hurt performance. Yang et al.’s AdaTT, introduced in 2023 at Kuaishou, tackled this with an adaptive task-to-task fusion network, dynamically balancing task interactions.\nAdaTT’s inputs—shared features (e.g., user ID, item ID)—map to embeddings feeding a shared bottom MLP: ( \\mathbf{z}_{\\text{shared}} = \\text{ReLU}(\\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{e} + \\mathbf{b}) ). Task-specific towers (e.g., CTR, CVR) process this into ( \\mathbf{z}t = \\text{MLP}t(\\mathbf{z}{\\text{shared}}) ). The innovation is an attention-based fusion: ( \\mathbf{z}t\u0026rsquo; = \\sum{s \\neq t} \\alpha{ts} \\mathbf{z}s ), where ( \\alpha{ts} ) weights contributions from other tasks, computed via a task-to-task attention MLP. Outputs are per-task sigmoids: ( \\hat{y}_t = \\sigma(\\mathbf{w}_t^T \\mathbf{z}_t\u0026rsquo;) ).\nThe loss is a weighted sum: ( L = \\sum_t \\lambda_t L_t ) (binary cross-entropy per task), optimized with Adam. On Kuaishou’s dataset, AdaTT lifted CTR AUC by 1.5% and CVR AUC by 2% over single-task models, thanks to its adaptive fusion—a leap over static MTL. Its complexity, though, demands careful tuning.\nConclusion: What’s Next From NCF’s non-linear leap to AdaTT’s multi-task finesse, DNNs have reshaped RecSys, each model solving a prior limitation: NCF broke linearity, Wide \u0026amp; Deep merged memorization and generalization, DeepFM automated engineering, DIN added sequence, DLRM scaled up, and AdaTT tackled multiple goals. Part 4 will explore graph neural networks and transformers, pushing RecSys further into complex, real-time domains.\nReferences He, X., et al. (2017).

In Part 1, we traced the evolution of RecSys from content-based filtering (CBF) to collaborative filtering (CF), and finally to Matrix Factorization (MF), which introduced latent factor models to tackle sparsity and scalability. However, MF’s linear assumptions and struggles with implicit feedback (e.g., clicks, views) set the stage for more advanced techniques. In this post, we dive into two pivotal methods from the 2010-2015 era: Factorization Machines (FM) and Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost).\nIn Part 2, you’ll learn how FM generalizes MF to handle diverse data types, how XGBoost leverages decision trees for ranking, and the strengths and limitations of each.\n1. Recap In Part 1, we explored the foundational stages of RecSys:\nCBF based on features (e.g., movie genres) but struggled with diversity. CF leveraged user-item interactions, introducing neighborhood methods and latent factor models. MF modeled users and items in a latent space, predicting ratings as \\(\\hat{r}_{ui} = p_u^T q_i\\). However, MF assumed linear interactions and worked best with explicit feedback (ratings) only, failed to capture implicit feedback like clicks or views. These limitations prompted the 2010-2015 era, where machine learning techniques like FM and XGBoost emerged to handle more complex patterns.\n2. In Layman terms Imagine you’re shopping in a store for a jacket. In Part 1, MF was like a salesman who suggested jackets based on your ratings, guessing your taste with simple categories like “likes warm jackets” or “prefers casual style.” It worked well when you rated items, but what if you never rating? or what if the assistant only knows you clicked on a jacket or viewed its picture? MF struggles here because it’s too rigid. Enter Factorization Machines (FM) and XGBoost—two smarter assistants who arrived around 2010 to fix this.\nFM: It\u0026rsquo;s like a smart salesman who looks at everything—you clicked, the weather, and your profile (e.g., you’re a runner), mixing these clues to suggest a waterproof running jacket if it’s rainy. It’s flexible and can handle all kinds of hints, not just ratings.\nXGBoost: XGBoost is like a super-smart friend who learns from everyone’s shopping habits to suggest the perfect jacket. It builds a decision flowchart (Actually TREE): “If you like bright colors, and it’s winter, and you often buy on weekends, then try this red parka.” It improves its suggestions step by step.\nThese assistants are more flexible than MF, handling messy data and complex patterns, but they have limits, which we’ll explore as we move toward deep learning in Part 3.\n3. Prerequisites Dot product combines two vectors to measure similarity—think of it as a handshake between features (e.g., user preferences and item traits). Loss function measures prediction errors (e.g., squared error: \\((y - \\hat{y})^2\\)), regularization prevents overfitting, and optimization (e.g., gradient descent) minimizes the loss. One-hot encoding transforming raw data (e.g., user IDs, item categories) into usable inputs. From Part 1, recall MF models ratings as \\(\\hat{r}_{ui} = p_u^T q_i\\), where \\(p_u\\) and \\(q_i\\) are latent vectors, but it struggles with implicit feedback. For more on these topics, check out Linear Algebra Basics or Intro to Machine Learning.\n4. Deep Dive 4.1 Factorization Machines (FM) FM, introduced by Steffen Rendle in 2010, generalizes Matrix Factorization to model interactions between any features, not just users and items. It excels in sparse, high, dimensional settings like CTR prediction in online advertising, where data includes implicit feedback (clicks, views) and diverse features (user demographics, ad categories, context). FM’s ability to capture pairwise feature interactions without manual engineering made it a cornerstone for RecSys.\nHow It Works:\nFM models a prediction (e.g., click probability) as a combination of linear and pairwise feature interactions. For a feature vector \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) (where \\(n\\) is the number of features), the prediction is:\n$$ \\hat{y}(\\mathbf{x}) = w_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=i+1}^n \\langle v_i, v_j \\rangle x_i x_j $$\n\\(w_0\\): Global bias. \\(w_i\\): Weight for feature \\(x_i\\). \\(\\langle v_i, v_j \\rangle = v_i^T v_j\\): Dot product of latent vectors \\(v_i, v_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^k\\), modeling the interaction between features \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_j\\). \\(k\\): Number of latent factors (typically 10-100). This captures both linear effects ( \\(w_i x_i\\)) and pairwise interactions ( \\(\\langle v_i, v_j \\rangle x_i x_j\\)). For example, in CTR prediction, \\(x_i\\) might indicate the user, \\(x_j\\) the ad, and their interaction reflects compatibility.\nConnection to MF:\nIf \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) encodes only user \\(u\\) and item \\(i\\) (e.g., \\(x_u = 1\\), \\(x_i = 1\\), all others 0), FM reduces to MF: $$ \\hat{y}(\\mathbf{x}) = w_0 + w_u + w_i + \\langle v_u, v_i \\rangle $$ Here, \\(\\langle v_u, v_i \\rangle\\) mirrors MF’s \\(p_u^T q_i\\), but FM’s generality allows modeling additional features like user age or ad category.\nLoss Function:\nFM supports regression (rating prediction) or classification (click prediction). For regression:\n$$ L = \\sum_{(\\mathbf{x}, y) \\in D} (y - \\hat{y}(\\mathbf{x}))^2 + \\lambda (| \\mathbf{w} |_2^2 + | V |_F^2) $$\nFor classification (CTR):\n$$ L = \\sum_{(\\mathbf{x}, y) \\in D} \\log(1 + \\exp(-y \\hat{y}(\\mathbf{x}))) + \\lambda (| \\mathbf{w} |_2^2 + | V |_F^2) $$\n\\(D\\): Training data. \\(y\\): Target (e.g., 1 for click, -1 for no click). \\(\\lambda\\): Regularization to prevent overfitting. \\(V\\): Matrix of latent vectors \\(v_i\\). Optimization:\nRendle (2010) proposes three methods:\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Updates parameters incrementally for each sample, ideal for large datasets. Alternating Least Squares (ALS): Optimizes one parameter at a time, better for batch processing. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): A Bayesian approach, offering uncertainty estimates but slower.\nSGD is often preferred for scalability, with updates like: $$ w_i \\leftarrow w_i - \\eta \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_i}, \\quad v_i \\leftarrow v_i - \\eta \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_i} $$\n\\(\\eta\\): Learning rate. Input and Output:\nInput: Sparse feature vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) (e.g., one-hot encoded user ID, item ID, context). Output: Predicted score (e.g., click probability, rating). Real-World Example:\nAt Meta Ads, FM might model user-ad interactions by combining user demographics (e.g., age, location), ad features (e.g., category, keyword), and context (e.g., device type), predicting the likelihood of a click to optimize ad placement.\nTakeaways:\nCaptures pairwise feature interactions. Scales well in sparse, high-dimensional data. Excels in CTR prediction and implicit feedback tasks. Features: Handles both explicit and implicit feedback, scales to high-dimensional sparse data, captures feature interactions without manual engineering.\nLimitations: Limited to pairwise interactions, misses higher-order patterns (e.g., user-item-context triplets), and assumes linear combinations, which may not capture deep non-linearities.\nLed to: Deep learning models like DeepFM (2017), which combine FM with neural networks to learn higher-order interactions.\n4.2 Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost) XGBoost, introduced by Chen \u0026amp; Guestrin in 2016, leverages an ensemble of decision trees for ranking tasks in RecSys, excelling in search (e.g., Bing) and online advertising. It addresses MF and FM’s limitations in capturing non-linear patterns, using second-order optimization for efficiency and scalability.\nHow It Works:\nXGBoost builds a sequence of decision trees, each correcting the errors of the previous ones. For RecSys, it’s often used in learning-to-rank tasks (e.g., ranking search results or videos). Features include user behavior (clicks, watch time), item metadata (category, tags), and context (time, device). The prediction is:\n$$ \\hat{y}i = \\sum{t=1}^T f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i) $$\n\\(T\\): Number of trees. \\(f_t\\): Output of the \\(t\\)-th tree for input \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\). Loss Function:\nXGBoost optimizes a regularized objective:\n$$ L = \\sum_{i=1}^N l(y_i, \\hat{y}i) + \\sum{t=1}^T \\Omega(f_t) $$\n\\(l(y_i, \\hat{y}_i)\\): Loss, e.g., squared loss for regression, or pairwise ranking loss (e.g., LambdaRank). \\(\\Omega(f_t) = \\gamma T + \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda \\| \\mathbf{w}_t \\|_2^2\\): Regularization, where \\(T\\) is the number of leaves, and \\(\\mathbf{w}_t\\) are leaf weights. For ranking, it uses pairwise loss:\n$$ L = \\sum_{(i,j) \\in P} \\log(1 + \\exp(-(\\hat{y}_i - \\hat{y}_j))) $$\nwhere \\(P\\) is the set of relevant-irrelevant pairs. XGBoost uses a second-order approximation:\n$$ L \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left[ l(y_i, \\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}) + g_i f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i) + \\frac{1}{2} h_i f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i)^2 \\right] + \\Omega(f_t) $$\n\\(g_i = \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}}\\), \\(h_i = \\frac{\\partial^2 l}{\\partial (\\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)})^2}\\). This enables efficient tree construction, with features like column sampling and parallel processing for scalability.\nInput and Output:\nInput: Feature vectors (numerical or categorical, e.g., user watch time, item category). Output: Ranking scores for items. Real-World Example:\nAt Bing, XGBoost ranks search results by modeling features like query relevance, user click history, and page quality, ensuring the most relevant results appear at the top.\nKey Takeaways (XGBoost in 3 Points):\nCaptures non-linear patterns via tree ensembles. Robust to missing data and interpretable (feature importance). Excels in ranking tasks like search and ads. Features: Captures non-linear patterns, handles mixed feature types via tree splits, robust to missing data, interpretable (feature importance scores).\nLimitations: Struggles with extremely high-dimensional sparse data (e.g., one-hot encoded user/item IDs), computationally expensive for large datasets, requires careful feature engineering.\nLed to: Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) and other deep learning methods that automatically learn feature representations.\n6. Conclusion Part 2 has taken us from MF to FM’s flexible feature interactions and XGBoost’s non-linear ranking power. FM excels in CTR prediction by modeling sparse, implicit data, while XGBoost dominates ranking tasks with its ability to capture complex patterns. However, both methods hit limits—FM’s pairwise focus and XGBoost’s reliance on feature engineering couldn’t keep up with the complexity of modern RecSys. In Part 3, we’ll explore how deep learning overcomes these limitations, tackling unstructured data like images and text with models like Neural Collaborative Filtering and DeepFM, which leverage neural networks for higher-order interactions and automated feature learning.\n7.
